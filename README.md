# Credit-Card-Fraud Detection 
The project is to compare the performance of different models like OneClassSVM , Random Forest , K Nearest Neighbors , ANN and majority voting  in detecting fraud in credit card transactions. This also analyses tbhe effect of sampling methods (undersampling and oversampling using SMOTE ) on imbalanced dataset


## Dataset
The dataset used for the project is publicly available here https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


## Language used for the project
Python 

## Libraries 
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Keras
Scikit learn
Seaborn
Tensorflow


## Platform 
The source can be uploaded and run successfully in Google Collab .
The above python libraries have to be installed if the code needs to be run on Jupiter notebook .
